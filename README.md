This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### About the project

On this project are used React (with Hooks) and Redux, in order to manage the state and save everything in the store.
When an action will be triggered, the reducer will update the state inside the store (creating a copy of it, since we can't change the state directly). After saving the state, will be updated also the localStorage.
Actually I have more spare time and I'm focusing to learn better the React Hooks approach. I'm trying also to refine my skills with Redux, so I used both in order to show you my willingness to improve me using also technologies that I have no much experience with.
Since you recommended me to not spend more than 4 hours, probably the styles are not like I wanted to, but everything is custom, so I didn't use any library.
